<h1>Vulnerability Assessment Report</h1>
In this lab, I am documenting the steps I take in order to install Adguard Home on my Raspberry Pi to create my own personal DNS Server. The DNS server's main role on my network is to increase privacy andd security for any device that is on my network.

<h2>Why I Created My Own DNS Server</h2>
Creating my own DNS server will allow me to control my network's domain name resolution process. To dive deeper, having my own DNS server grants me the capabilities of privacy and security. There are even very small instances of performance boosts that can be observed. Some of the benefits of having my own DNS server are as follows:

- AD Blocking
- DNS Request Blocking
- Reduced Risk of Malware/Phishing
- Safe Search
- Parental Controls
- DNS Rewrites
- Very Slight Performance Boost
- Much More!

Like stated before, this is a great way to take out some of the guesswork of avoiding ads, trackers, and the wild west of what we call the internet. The imposed rules, filters, and blocklists will automate security practices. This project also has a sleek dashboard similar to that of a SIEM tool that I can use to monitor incoming and outgoing traffic. Although the DNS server will intervene when told to do so, this does not take away all the responsibility from the user who is accessing the network and internet. Anyone on my network must still practice safe measures. Coming up, I will show what a natural ad query request looks like and how my computer responds to it compared to its response to an ad query with our DNS server in place and active.
