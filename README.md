<h1>Vulnerability Assessment Report</h1>

<b>Vulnerability assessments are like giving your IT infrastructure a check-up! Running an assessment consists of scanning networks and systems to sniff out weaknesses before any threat actors do. With these assessments, organizations can prioritize fixing up their digital defenses, keeping sensitive data safe and staying on the good side of regulatory requirements. It's like having a trusty sidekick in the ever-evolving world of tech!

There are three parts to my documentation: 1) Risk Assessment, 2) Approach, and 3) Remediation Strategy. I was mainly just having fun with the report and getting to know how to do an assessment while also getting familiar with the NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1. The first document is my report and the second one is the NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1 document.
